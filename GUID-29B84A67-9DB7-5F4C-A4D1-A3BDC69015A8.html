<h1 class="topictitle1">Additional
System Wide Power States</h1>
<div><p>A base port can add new power states to improve power management
for phone hardware. </p>

<p>The Kernel defines three system wide power states. A base port can add
new power states to improve power management for phone hardware. </p>

<p>The generic system wide power states that are defined are <em>Active</em>, <em>Standby</em> and <em>Off</em>.
Any additional sub-states of the <em>Active</em> power state must be wholly
managed by the base port. These states may not need to be declared explicitly
and may result from peripherals, or groups of peripherals, having moved to
their low power state (see also <a href="GUID-1D3E61BD-C09D-51FD-A10B-22392FDAEFEC.html#GUID-1D3E61BD-C09D-51FD-A10B-22392FDAEFEC__GUID-DCB8EA90-9B5F-5BA1-8D22-124980AC6B34">moving
to their low power state</a>). The device will then “trickle“ into one
of these sub-states instead of transitioning into them as a result of a user
action or system policy decision. </p>

<p>Usually, the transition of the system into one of the additional low power
states happens when the CPU enters the idle mode. The transition may be automatic
and wholly managed by the ASSP hardware or may result from an action taken
by the software routine that prepares the CPU to go to idle mode. </p>

the base port uses the idle mode to put the CPU and the device into hardware
“Sleep” mode similar to that which can be achieved with a transition to <em>Standby</em> mode
as described in the implementation issues for <a href="GUID-34D1D0BF-20DE-5677-A067-8FF9DD72E703.html#GUID-34D1D0BF-20DE-5677-A067-8FF9DD72E703__GUID-1F77C71C-D226-58BB-ABAE-43F958CC0C61">implementing
DPowerController::PowerDown()</a>  </p>
 <p>When called, the power controller’s <a href="GUID-34D1D0BF-20DE-5677-A067-8FF9DD72E703.html#GUID-34D1D0BF-20DE-5677-A067-8FF9DD72E703__GUID-E2A072D0-A67F-5E6D-81ED-CFD77B6ED4F1">DPowerController::CpuIdle() </a> implementation
could take the necessary steps to prepare the CPU and the platform to go to
“Sleep”. </p>
 <p>There is a balance between the power savings obtained from
moving the CPU and platform into “Sleep” mode in Idle and the performance
hit resulting from spending time restoring the status after coming out of
“Sleep” mode. Usually the <samp class="codeph">CpuIdle()</samp> routine investigates
the timer queue (using <a href="GUID-C54D99AA-FF6E-3023-8260-8F5A88FBFBE0.html#GUID-C54D99AA-FF6E-3023-8260-8F5A88FBFBE0__GUID-69103F26-2C21-3ECA-9DB5-C31A41F6C238"><span class="apiname">NTimerQ::IdleTime()</span></a>) for the next
timer expiration and decides to move or not to move the CPU and platform into
“Sleep” mode based on how much time there is before the next timer expiration.
The threshold above which it is considered productive to move into “Sleep”
is dependent on the base port. </p>
 <p>The decision to move into “Sleep” mode
may also be based on the current level of activity, or collected metrics on
the length of time spent in Idle, or other historical information. This can
be implemented entirely by the base port, or it may require the services of
an external component (such as, for example, Speed Management). </p>
 <p>The
transition to a hardware “Sleep” mode may also depend on shared peripherals
being in a particular state, for example, no pending requests from other peripherals.
This means that the power controller may need to check with the peripheral
driver before initiating the change. The power controller could use the ASSP/Variant
method to access the resource manager and check the usage of a shared peripheral
using its <samp class="codeph">GetCount()</samp> API. </p>
 <p>The decision to move into
“Sleep” mode could be dependent on a number of peripherals (shared and not
shared) being in Standby and a number of controllable power resources being
turned off. Therefore the power controller may also need to check with the
resource manager (through the Variant or ASSP) for the state of a specific
set of controllable power resources (using the <samp class="codeph">ResourceManager::GetResourceState()</samp> API). </p>
 <p>On
going to “Sleep”, an action or set of actions might need to be taken that
would affect the whole platform. An example of this is when DRAM is put into
self-refresh mode on entering the CPU Idle mode after all peripherals that
might access it (including the LCD controller and DSP) are in low power state.
Unused DRAM banks may also be powered down. </p>
 <p>The following diagram
exemplifies how the evolution of system power would look like on a system
when the most power saving “Sleep” mode can only be reached – from Idle -
when Peripherals A, B and C are already in their low power mode. On going
to the most power saving “Sleep” mode, additional actions can be taken to
lower the system power level: </p>

</ul>
 <p>Any transition to and from these low power states must be transparent
to the rest of the system. A transparent transition is one that can be instantly
reversed, perhaps automatically in hardware, and has no noticeable impact
on system performance. In other words, it should be possible to wake the processor
up and move the entire device to Active Mode as if coming from a “normal”
Idle Mode. </p>
 <p>To perform a system wide power change which is not transparent,
peripherals that may be affected by the transition would need to be examined,
and interfaces would have to be provided so that the users of these peripherals
could query the peripheral and allow or disallow the system transition into
that state. </p>
