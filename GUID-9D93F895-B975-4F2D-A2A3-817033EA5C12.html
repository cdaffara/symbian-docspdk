<div><p>This topic explains how memory barriers are used to maintain data

a thread is executed on a single CPU system, there is an order to the read/write
operations to shared memory and I/O. Since read and write operations cannot

</div>
<p>Figure 1 shows how shared memory and I/O is handled on a single CPU
system. The CPU switches between threads (this is called a context switch).
Because only one thread can be executed at once, read and write operations
to shared memory and I/O cannot occur at the same time. Hence the integrity
of the data can be maintained.</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows how shared memory and I/O is handled on a multi CPU
system. In this system, it is possible that the read/write order will not
be the one expected. This is due performance decisions made by the hardware
used to interface memory to the rest of the system. Without some form of synchronisation
mechanism in place, data corruption will occur.</p>
<p>To safeguard the integrity
of data, a new synchronisation method known as a memory barrier has been implemented.</p>
 
   </div>

<div class="section" id="GUID-9D93F895-B975-4F2D-A2A3-817033EA5C12__GUID-1512CFA2-E4F7-4B02-90B3-A02BC560B821"><a name="GUID-9D93F895-B975-4F2D-A2A3-817033EA5C12__GUID-1512CFA2-E4F7-4B02-90B3-A02BC560B821"><!-- --></a><h2 class="sectiontitle">Memory Barriers</h2><p>Memory
barriers are used to enforce the order of memory access. They are also known
as membar, memory fence or a fence instruction.</p>
<p>An example of their
use is :</p>
<pre class="codeblock">thread 1: 

	a = 1;
	b = 1;

thread 2: 

	while (b != 1);
	assert(a==1);
</pre>
<p>In the above code on a single-core system, the condition in
the assert statement would always be true, because the order of read/write
operations can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>However on a multi-core system where the
read/write operations cannot be guaranteed, a synchronization method has to
be implemented that allows the contents of the shared memory to by synchronized
across the whole system. This synchronisation method is the memory barrier.</p>
<p>With
the above example, the memory barrier implementation would be :</p>
<pre class="codeblock">thread 1: 

	a = 1;
	memory_barrier;
	b = 1;

thread 2: 

	while (b != 1);
	memory_barrier;
	assert(a==1);
</pre>
<p>In the above example, the first memory barrier makes sure that
the variables a and b are written to in the specified order. The second memory
barrier makes sure that the read operations are done in the correct order
(the value of variable b is read before the value of variable a).</p>
<p> Two
forms of memory barrier are supported by the Symbian platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One that will only allow any subsequent memory access if all the previous
memory access operations have been observed.</p>
<p> This memory barrier does
not guarantee the order of completion of the memory requests.</p>
<p> This
equates to the ARM DMB (Data Memory Barrier) instruction.</p>
<p> This is implemented
via the<samp class="codeph"> __e32_memory_barrier()</samp> function.</p>
</li>

<li><p>One that ensures that all previous memory and I/O access operations
are complete before any new access instructions can be executed.</p>
<p> This
equates to the ARM DSB (Data Synchronisation Barrier) instruction. The difference
between this form of memory barrier and the previous one, is that all of the
cache operations will have been completed before the memory barrier instruction
completes and that no instruction can be executed until the memory barrier
instruction has been completed.</p>
<p>This is implemented via the <samp class="codeph">___e32_io_completion_barrier()</samp> function.</p>
</li>

</ul>
<p>Memory barriers are used in implementing lockless algorithms, which
perform shared memory operations without using locks. They are used in areas
where performance is a prime requirement.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that memory
barriers would be used by anyone other than device drivers (especially the <samp class="codeph">__e32_io_completion_barrier()</samp> function).
It is also unlikely that these functions would be used on their own. Instead
they are most likely to be called via one of the atomic operation functions.
An example of their use is :</p>
<pre class="codeblock">         /* Make sure change to iTail is not observed before the trace data reads which preceded the call to this function. */
         __e32_memory_barrier();
         buffer-&gt;iTail += iLastGetDataSize;
</pre>
