consider the size of all displays to be fixed, assuming them to be built into

had a screen size of 220 x 176 pixels. Over time, these were followed by higher
resolution screens, such as 440 x 252 pixels. Applications that were designed
for 220 x 176 pixel screens could run on 440 x 252 pixel screens because the
Window Server simply scaled the pixels by a factor of two. </p>
 <p>However,
this approach did not work when phones with 320 x 240 pixel screens were introduced,
because each axis required a different scaling factor. Symbian introduced
the <strong>screen mode</strong> feature to handle this and similar use cases. Device
creators define in the <a href="GUID-1D529BDC-6665-58E2-AB3F-7023D8A84F69.html" title="This topic provides a reference to the wsini.ini file parameters. Some of the parameters are general, some are screen-specific and some are specific to individual plug-ins.">wsini.ini
file</a> a number of screen modes for each physical screen on the device.
For each screen mode the device creator defines parameters to control the
offset from the top left corner of the screen, the height and width in both
pixels and twips, <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> axis scaling factors and so on. The
Window Server uses these to position and scale old applications so that they
can run on new phones with higher resolutions, as shown in the following diagram
(which is not drawn to scale). The screen mode is still used in the same way
in the <a href="GUID-F64E6551-670E-5E12-8103-DE504D3EC94F.html" title="ScreenPlay provides improved support for graphics hardware acceleration and some other new features.

 <p>There are several similar use cases, such as swapping between portrait
and landscape orientations and flip phones that have a flap that, when closed,
partially obscures the main screen. The Window Server uses the screen mode
parameters to display applications differently depending on whether the phone
is in portrait or landscape orientation and whether the flap is open or closed.
The screen mode represents the area that is presented to the application and
is available to application developers through <a href="GUID-30479BE3-296E-3B4D-914D-B080ABD733E4.html#GUID-30479BE3-296E-3B4D-914D-B080ABD733E4__GUID-8E1B5729-FD1C-3D4A-AC73-C6364E7D5BBF"><span class="apiname">CWsScreenDevice::SizeInPixels()</span></a>. </p>

file</a> in this way means that all possible screen sizes and resolutions
must be fixed and known at ROM building time. This approach has limitations
when working with technologies such as HDMI and composite video connectors,

until runtime. </p>

resolution of the full composition/display area can be determined at runtime.
The full UI area is mapped to fill this display area but may be a lower virtual
resolution, which is scaled. The render stage chain handles the
scaling and positioning of applications and any external surfaces within the
UI, and the composition engine performs the scaling of the pixel data to the
actual display area at physical resolution. This has the advantage that the
scaling can be handled by the graphics acceleration hardware, if it is available. </p>
 <p>Another
advantage of this approach is that it enables dynamic scaling of the pixels.
Usually pixels are square on a mobile phone display, but not square on many
external displays. When the square pixels from the device are displayed on
such a display, they may need to be scaled by different arbitrary factors
on each axis. This is called <strong>anisotropic scaling</strong>. In contrast, <strong>isotropic
scaling</strong> means that both pixel axes are scaled by the same arbitrary factor. </p>
 <p>The
following diagram illustrates how the full UI area is mapped to fill the display/composition
area. The application's area (which corresponds to the screen mode) is referred
to as the <strong>application extent</strong> in ScreenPlay. </p>
 <div class="fignone" id="GUID-0EBE5733-A267-5F4A-85AD-87C3ECF80731__GUID-724DB4EE-1F45-58D9-889C-B42ECEE7208D"><a name="GUID-0EBE5733-A267-5F4A-85AD-87C3ECF80731__GUID-724DB4EE-1F45-58D9-889C-B42ECEE7208D"><!-- --></a><span class="figcap">Figure 2.

 <p>ScreenPlay handles application sizing and positioning in a fundamentally
different way from the non-ScreenPlay variant. Using a fixed offset to position
the application within the screen is inadequate when connecting to an external
HDMI display, for example, when the resolution may not be known until runtime.
For example, the offset designed for a QVGA display does not position the
application correctly in a higher resolution display, as shown in the following
diagram, where the red cross indicates the offset for a QVGA display. </p>
 <div class="fignone" id="GUID-0EBE5733-A267-5F4A-85AD-87C3ECF80731__GUID-A2816D08-B61F-5605-B6AF-A9D186F6BED5"><a name="GUID-0EBE5733-A267-5F4A-85AD-87C3ECF80731__GUID-A2816D08-B61F-5605-B6AF-A9D186F6BED5"><!-- --></a><span class="figcap">Figure 3.

 <p>In ScreenPlay there is no scaling of the application extent relative
to the full UI area—there is always a 1:1 pixel correspondence between them.
In addition, although supported, the screen mode offset is not necessarily
used. Instead, the render stage chain selects an appropriate virtual resolution
and handles the positioning—for example, centering it and using a best fit
algorithm so that it takes up as much of the screen as possible or using the
offset as a minimum margin size. The device creator can choose how to implement
this in the render stages. In order to position the application correctly
within the UI area, the Window Server gets the positioning information from
the first render stage in the chain when the configuration or screen mode
changes. </p>
 <p>ScreenPlay supports fixed screen modes in the <a href="GUID-1D529BDC-6665-58E2-AB3F-7023D8A84F69.html" title="This topic provides a reference to the wsini.ini file parameters. Some of the parameters are general, some are screen-specific and some are specific to individual plug-ins.">wsini.ini
file</a>, although the scaling parameters are not used. However, the screen
mode width and height in pixels and twips when specified and used together,
provide the pixel aspect ratio. In order to maintain backwards compatibility,
render stages should respect this aspect ratio whenever possible. </p>
 <p>It
is possible for applications to determine and draw to the UI area outside
the application extent using the APIs described below. However, <strong>dynamic
screen modes</strong> provide an alternative mechanism for existing applications
to access the full UI area. This is particularly suitable for HDMI and similar
technologies where the resolution may not be known until runtime. To use this
approach, the device creator must define one or two screen modes in the <a href="GUID-1D529BDC-6665-58E2-AB3F-7023D8A84F69.html" title="This topic provides a reference to the wsini.ini file parameters. Some of the parameters are general, some are screen-specific and some are specific to individual plug-ins.">wsini.ini file</a> and
set their height and width in pixels to -1. One dynamic screen mode then represents
the current display configuration and the other one, if present, represents
the configuration when the screen is rotated by 90º or 270º. Using dynamic
screen modes means that the display configuration can be changed at runtime
according to the hardware that is available and detected by the composition
engine. </p>
 <p>When a dynamic screen mode is used, the application extent
always fills the full UI space and the area returned by <a href="GUID-30479BE3-296E-3B4D-914D-B080ABD733E4.html#GUID-30479BE3-296E-3B4D-914D-B080ABD733E4__GUID-8E1B5729-FD1C-3D4A-AC73-C6364E7D5BBF"><span class="apiname">CWsScreenDevice::SizeInPixels()</span></a> always
matches the actual resolution that is in use. </p>
