device creation</strong> </p>
<p>         There are two ways of equipping an application
with a keyspace when the application is installed on the device. One is to
save the keyspace to the directory <span class="filepath">z:\private\10202BE9\</span>at
ROM build, as explained above. This method has the disadvantage that a keyspace
created in this way cannot subsequently be uninstalled, though it can be modified
by the software installer or firmware upgrades. The other way is to install
the keyspace along with the application using the software installer. Application
writers cannot do this on their own because the process requires one of the
necessary files, the stub .sis file, to be set up appropriately by device
creators, and another, the upgrade .sis file, to be signed by Symbian.  </p>
<p> 
        You install a keyspace by placing a stub .sis file (installation file)
in the <span class="filepath">\System\Install</span>&lt;file&gt;\System\Install&lt;/file&gt;
directory in ROM. This file is written by device creators rather than developers.
It must contain the central repository server executable. It must list all
the ROM-supplied keyspace files which are ntended to be upgradable.   </p>
<p> 
        The following template is supplied for use in device creation. Device
creators are free to modify the major and minor version numbers but are strongly
recommended to retain the UID 0x20007770 which is allocated for use with the
central repository.  </p>

 <p><strong>How to upgrade a keyspace during software installation</strong> </p>
 <p>Installing
an application is explained <a href="GUID-9C4C3F93-4F9F-5FE0-9979-7729CE255255.html">here</a> and
upgrading is explained <a href="GUID-0B9C52E5-490D-5CF0-9789-1EC50D6C7919.html">here</a>.
Upgrading software in ROM is explained <a href="GUID-30FFE6C4-FE79-55F9-A805-D98F83D90441.html">here</a>.
It involves using the CreateSIS tool to compile files listed in a package
(.pkg) file into an installation (.sis) file. A package file may refer to
an existing .sis file: if so, the .sis file is said to be embedded. An upgrade
is essentially the installation of a software patch. You upgrade a keyspace
in the same way as you upgrade the associated application and the two operations
are often combined. Installing a keyspace is the same as upgrading one: you
are eclipsing the stub .sis file discussed in the previous section. To do
this you need: </p>

and corresponding .sis file, </p>
 </li>

.pkg file and corresponding .sis file if you are upgrading the application. </p>
 </li>

</ul>
 <p>A third party developer cannot create a stub .sis file: it must have
been created as part of the device's ROM. If one does not exist, you cannot
upgrade a keyspace. </p>
 <p>The upgrade .sis file must be signed. </p>
 <p>You
do not need the application .sis and .pkg files if you are installing or upgrading
a keyspace without the associated application. </p>
 <p>In both cases you write
a .pkg file with details of the software upgrade. It can upgrade the application
and the keyspace at the same time or could upgrade the keyspace alone as shown
in the following example: </p>
 <pre class="codeblock" id="GUID-998DCA78-2488-5D6D-B5B3-D86C52F32823__GUID-5436AF6A-5A82-51A4-BC52-3FEDFCBA431F"><a name="GUID-998DCA78-2488-5D6D-B5B3-D86C52F32823__GUID-5436AF6A-5A82-51A4-BC52-3FEDFCBA431F"><!-- --></a>&amp;EN

</pre>
 <p>The important thing is that the package UID, (0x20007770),
must match the UID in the stub package header. You compile the .pkg file into
a .sis file and, if required, go through the signing process at this point.
At this point you can deploy the keyspace .sis file on its own. However, it
is more usual to embed the keyspace .sis file into your application .pkg file
and install the application. </p>
 <p><strong>How to uninstall a keyspace during
software uninstallation</strong> </p>
 <p>You uninstall a keyspace by uninstalling
the application which it was embedded in. This has the effect of uninstalling
all the software patches with which you upgraded the keyspace. If there is
a version of the keyspace in ROM, placed there at device creation, it comes
back into use. If the keyspace was installed subsequently then no version
of it remains after uninstallation. It is not possible to remove individual
upgrades, only the entire set of upgrades which have ever been applied. </p>
 <p><strong>Effects
of upgrading a keyspace during software installation</strong> </p>
 <p>An upgrade
to a keyspace may conflict with user modifications to the keyspace. In that
case the existing settings are merged with those in the upgrading keyspace
in accordance with the following rules. The keyspaces are merged in accordance
with the principle that user modifications override upgrade modifications. </p>
 <ul>
<li id="GUID-998DCA78-2488-5D6D-B5B3-D86C52F32823__GUID-D0E7853C-D91D-53C4-9DA8-C581A9AB5A79"><a name="GUID-998DCA78-2488-5D6D-B5B3-D86C52F32823__GUID-D0E7853C-D91D-53C4-9DA8-C581A9AB5A79"><!-- --></a><p>If a setting exists
in the existing keyspace on the phone and the upgrading keyspace and the existing
setting has not been modified by the user, the upgrading setting replaces
the existing setting. </p>

in the existing keyspace and the upgrading keyspace and the existing setting
has been modified by the user, the existing setting is preserved. </p>

in the existing keyspace but not in the upgrading keyspace, the existing setting
is preserved. </p>
 </li>

<li id="GUID-998DCA78-2488-5D6D-B5B3-D86C52F32823__GUID-1270CCEC-7836-51BA-99EA-9BD46CA4BBCA"><a name="GUID-998DCA78-2488-5D6D-B5B3-D86C52F32823__GUID-1270CCEC-7836-51BA-99EA-9BD46CA4BBCA"><!-- --></a><p>If a setting exists
in the upgrading keyspace but not in the existing keyspace, the upgrading
setting is created. </p>
 </li>

</ul>
 <p>Upgrades preserve the existing platform security policies. Metadata
values assigned by default or to a range remain unchanged, but metadata values
of individual keys take their upgrade settings. </p>
 <p>The first time you
upgrade a keyspace which is provided in ROM you only need to list the keys
which are being added to or changed from the ROM keyspace. However, if you
are performing an upgrade to a keyspace which has previously been upgraded,
you must include all the changes in all the previous upgrades: this is also
the case where the keyspace was originally installed as an upgrade to a stub
.sis file. </p>
 <p>If there are notification requests on any of the keys,
the requests will complete as a result of installation, upgrading and uninstallation.
If transactions are pending during an upgrade or uninstallation, those transactions
will fail. It is advisable to close all sessions on a keyspace before uninstalling. </p>

for firmware updates to ROM over a serial connection or by FOTA (firmware
over the air). The generic term for these firmware updates is FOTx. When this
happens, the Central Repository detects the upgrade when the device is next
restarted and makes corresponding updates to its keyspaces. A firmware update
reboots the device: as part of this process the Central Repository gets the
current ROM version using <samp class="codeph">SysUtil::GetSWVersion</samp> and compares
it with a previously saved version. Where the Central Repository detects a
difference it merges the relevant keyspaces at the level of the file or of
individual settings. </p>
 <p>The rule is that user values (settings modified
by the user) override SWI values (settings modified by a software upgrade
or installation) and that SWI values override ROM values. </p>
 <p>There are
two cases where a difference is resolved at the level of the file. </p>

 <p>Where the ROM update conflicts with user-modified keyspaces or SWI-modified
