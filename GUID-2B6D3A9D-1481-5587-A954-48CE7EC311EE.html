 <p>For a diagram of the <a href="GUID-7ED11E23-6E13-36D4-BB10-8AE9E745C560.html"><span class="apiname">TDisplayConfiguration</span></a> class hierarchy, see the <a href="GUID-19C3DA8C-0128-5172-B859-4FD6F6197451.html" title="The Common Graphics Headers component contains classes that are used by a number of ScreenPlay components and their clients. The classes are divided between those that relate to surfaces and those that relate to display configuration.">Common Graphics Headers Component Overview</a>. </p>
 <p>A render stage uses the <a href="GUID-415B5416-A6DD-3471-8800-C76C48DA59DA.html"><span class="apiname">MWsDisplayControl</span></a> interface to intercept <a href="GUID-8391795F-3766-3F31-BDFA-832AE8B4DFD4.html#GUID-8391795F-3766-3F31-BDFA-832AE8B4DFD4__GUID-E4DE786F-547E-3A3B-90D2-31892A708E25"><span class="apiname">MDisplayControlBase::GetResolutions()</span></a> calls at runtime. A render stage can add <strong>virtual resolutions</strong> into the list of display resolutions in order to scale the full UI area to the full composition area. Using virtual resolutions in this way reduces the memory required for the UI buffers and allows the Window Server to work purely in the application UI coordinate space. Virtual resolutions are marked with a flag in the <a href="GUID-15E9E782-1D64-3E7C-8D43-51DF267FE6A9.html"><span class="apiname">TResolution</span></a> structure provided by <samp class="codeph">GetResolutions()</samp>. The structure also includes the size of the resolution in both pixels and twips. A render stage may also remove physical resolutions from the list in order to disable the client's ability to change the resolution. </p>
 <p>A render stage that provides virtual resolutions can include one (or more) virtual resolutions that give the UI pixel aspect ratio to fit a screen mode defined in the <a href="GUID-1D529BDC-6665-58E2-AB3F-7023D8A84F69.html" title="This topic provides a reference to the wsini.ini file parameters. Some of the parameters are general, some are screen-specific and some are specific to individual plug-ins.">wsini.ini file</a>. However, this may require anisotropic scaling of the UI surface in the composition engine. For example, PAL has 720 x 576 non-square pixels. To get approximately square pixels, virtual resolutions of either 788 x 576 or 720 x 540 would work on a 4:3 display, and 1050 x 576 or 720 x 395 would work on a 16:9 display. The choice of stretching or shrinking virtual resolutions may depend on the quality of scaling available and other factors, and should only be used for backwards compatibility purposes. This is because 1:1 or integer scaling generally gives a better appearance for user interfaces. Providing shrinking virtual resolutions may also raise expectations in applications of a higher horizontal resolution than actually exists. </p>
 <p>The term <strong>real resolution</strong> is used for the display resolutions that are returned by the composition engine adaptation. These correspond to the supported composition spaces that the Window Server can select for output. These may be scaled and filtered beyond the composition engine adaptation (for example, in the physical display device, such as an HDMI TV). </p>
 <p>In addition to defining static screen modes in the <a href="GUID-1D529BDC-6665-58E2-AB3F-7023D8A84F69.html" title="This topic provides a reference to the wsini.ini file parameters. Some of the parameters are general, some are screen-specific and some are specific to individual plug-ins.">wsini.ini file</a>, device creators can define one or two <strong>dynamic screen modes</strong> in the <a href="GUID-1D529BDC-6665-58E2-AB3F-7023D8A84F69.html" title="This topic provides a reference to the wsini.ini file parameters. Some of the parameters are general, some are screen-specific and some are specific to individual plug-ins.">wsini.ini file</a>. These are used to represent the current display configuration—one for 0° and 180° rotations and the other for 90° and 270° rotations. The latter has the dimensions in both pixels and in twips swapped, to appear similar to the static modes. You define a dynamic screen mode by setting the <samp class="codeph">SCR_WIDTH</samp> and <samp class="codeph">SCR_HEIGHT</samp> parameters to -1. If there is only one dynamic mode, it is not possible to use the <a href="GUID-30479BE3-296E-3B4D-914D-B080ABD733E4.html"><span class="apiname">CWsScreenDevice</span></a> API to change the current rotation by 90 degrees. </p>
 <p>If <a href="GUID-0C384D35-77DD-318E-AF3E-C9ED5ADD9D11.html#GUID-0C384D35-77DD-318E-AF3E-C9ED5ADD9D11__GUID-EC440412-68AA-36F1-9DD4-DD85EF09E2B2"><span class="apiname">MDisplayControl::SetConfiguration()</span></a> is used to change the configuration, the dynamic mode(s) are updated as necessary. With two dynamic modes, if one is the current mode, the other generally becomes the new mode (even if only the resolution changed, for example) so that applications see a mode number change. The only time this does not happen is in the case of a 180° rotation, because the static mode behavior is to retain the current mode. </p>
 <p>Whenever the dynamic mode data changes, or a new mode is selected, an <a href="GUID-CC1E6B2E-F68F-3A00-B4EA-4917007F7320.html"><span class="apiname">EEventScreenDeviceChanged</span></a> event is sent to all clients that have enabled it. Window Server client functions are provided to query whether the current or a given mode index is dynamic. </p>
 <p>Without dynamic size modes, an application can still use the full display, by positioning windows outside the reported display area. </p>

In ScreenPlay, there are several coordinate spaces and there is a common requirement to map a rectangle from one space to another.

The main purpose of <a href="GUID-0A31CF3E-25A9-36BA-80D6-8FBD18419506.html"><span class="apiname">MWsDisplayPolicy</span></a> is to enable the render stage chain to position the application extent as intelligently as possible to suit the resolution. However, there is no requirement for the render stage chain to implement the interface. If it is not implemented, the offset defined in the <a href="GUID-1D529BDC-6665-58E2-AB3F-7023D8A84F69.html" title="This topic provides a reference to the wsini.ini file parameters.

 </li>
 </ul>
 <p>On failure, the current screen mode and display resolution are retained, but a screen device changed event should still be sent, because there is no way to return failure to the caller. </p>
 <p>Applications are given the static offset associated with the screen mode, not the offset described above. Note that because of the way that DSA works, if the render stage uses a <a href="GUID-B229156F-2344-3F46-8542-AC65882D80DE.html"><span class="apiname">CFbsScreenDevice</span></a> object for rendering, the DSA buffer and the UI buffer are the same (that is, the Screen Driver surface). This means that the offset returned by this policy function must be the same as the one passed in. The policy function has the option to reject the mode change, however. </p>
 <p>The Symbian <em>display</em> render stage applies a "best fit" approach, taking into account virtual resolutions if configured, whereby the offset and resolution are chosen to make the screen mode fill as much of the display as possible, while retaining the same (or very similar) pixel aspect ratio. The offset may be limited if the Screen Driver surface is being used for rendering, as described above. The quality of the scaling of screen modes to virtual resolutions and real resolutions is determined by the <samp class="codeph">DP_SCALING</samp>  <a href="GUID-1D529BDC-6665-58E2-AB3F-7023D8A84F69.html" title="This topic provides a reference to the wsini.ini file parameters. Some of the parameters are general, some are screen-specific and some are specific to individual plug-ins.">wsini.ini file</a> parameter. However, more typically a render stage would implement just one scaling mode, and not require configuration. </p>
