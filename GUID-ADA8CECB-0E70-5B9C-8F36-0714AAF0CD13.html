<div><p>This topic provides an introduction to <strong>graphics composition surfaces</strong>, which are usually simply called <strong>surfaces</strong>. Surfaces are pixel buffers that have associated metadata describing the width, height, stride and pixel format and are used as input to the composition components. Surfaces can be multi-buffered and are identified by a 128-bit identifier (called the surface ID). </p>

ScreenPlay enables device creators to take advantage of improved software performance, hardware acceleration and third party graphics engines. ScreenPlay is sometimes known as the New Graphics Architecture (NGA).">ScreenPlay</a>. <strong>Target audience</strong>: Device creators. </p>
 <p>Surfaces that are used as input to the composition engine are shared between at least two processes: the Window Server process (in which the composition engine runs) and a <strong>renderer</strong>, which is responsible for rendering the content to the surface. The camera viewfinder, the video renderer and EGL are examples of renderers. Each process needs to access the surface to read or write (draw) data. Other processes may also need one or both types of access. Each of these processes uses the surface ID to gain access to the surface or its properties. </p>

 <p>Surfaces can be created by using the Surface Manager API. To do this, you first create an instance of the client-side class <a href="GUID-733B8BFA-7BC2-3A6D-A66F-F788413D25A9.html"><span class="apiname">RSurfaceManager</span></a>. This encapsulates the complexities of device driver communication, memory management and thread safety. To create a surface, you must specify the number of buffers and low-level properties, such as pixel format, stride and memory contiguity. See <a href="GUID-E238B1FE-BBD8-5C6D-AE04-258188EFF9FF.html" title="This tutorial first shows you how to create a composition surface using the Surface Manager API. It then shows you how to create second surface that shares the same memory.">Creating a Graphics Surface Tutorial</a> for more information. </p>
 <p><strong>Binding the surface to a window </strong> </p>
 <p>You bind a surface to a window by calling <a href="GUID-733B8BFA-7BC2-3A6D-A66F-F788413D25A9.html"><span class="apiname">RWindowBase::SetBackgroundSurface()</span></a>. You can apply a number of <strong>configuration</strong> settings to the surface, such as viewport, rotation and extent. These crop, scale and rotate the surface content. If the configuration is not set, the entire surface is mapped to the window extent with normal orientation. See <a href="GUID-495EA1C8-E95F-54AE-B4D1-0F463003C2D7.html" title="This topic provides an introduction to displaying an external surface on a window. The surface is then known as a background surface. This feature is available in ScreenPlay only.">External Surfaces Overview</a> for more information. </p>
 <p><strong>Rendering content to the surface and composition </strong> </p>
 <p>The renderer renders the graphics content directly to a buffer within the surface. The renderer then sends a request to the composition engine through the <a href="GUID-8E8FE99A-5F4D-5B0F-87AB-A58EB4BEB6E9.html" title="Each graphics composition surface has at least two interested stakeholders: the process responsible for drawing and maintaining the content and the composition engine, which uses the surface for creating the display. When one of the stakeholders does something to the surface, it usually means that another stakeholder needs to do something too. The Surface Update component provides a channel for the stakeholders to inform each other of changes.">Surface Update component</a> to indicate that the surface is ready for composition. The renderer specifies the surface ID, the ID of the current buffer within the surface and optionally the dirty rectangle and the screen on which the surface is to be displayed. Alternatively the request can be broadcast to all screens (this is called a <a href="GUID-D2ECF215-B53C-5659-BA86-5B658C0C2D2F.html" title="Global surface updates are surface composition update commands that are submitted to all displays rather than to a single one. This causes the Surface Update Server to broadcast the update to all of the registered composition engine instances. Each of these then determines whether the surface is displayed on its associated screen and if so, forces an update.">global surface update</a>). </p>
 <p>The composition engine then includes the surface in the next composition cycle. Because this can take some time, the composition engine carries out the composition asynchronously. The composition engine can notify the client when the buffer is available for rendering into again, in order to prevent tearing or artefacts. The composition engine can also notify the client when the buffer has been displayed a specified number of times, in order to ensure that each frame gets displayed for at least a given period of time. For more information, see <a href="GUID-8E8FE99A-5F4D-5B0F-87AB-A58EB4BEB6E9.html" title="Each graphics composition surface has at least two interested stakeholders: the process responsible for drawing and maintaining the content and the composition engine, which uses the surface for creating the display. When one of the stakeholders does something to the surface, it usually means that another stakeholder needs to do something too. The Surface Update component provides a channel for the stakeholders to inform each other of changes.">Surface Update Component Overview</a>. </p>
 <p> <em>Note</em>: In graphics, the term <strong>artefact</strong> is used to refer to an error that occurs when displaying or drawing an image on the screen. <strong>Tearing</strong> is a particular type of error in which part of the current frame and part of the previous frame are seen on the screen at the same time. This makes the image appear torn. Tearing is considered a serious error. </p>
 <p><strong>Removing the surface from window </strong> </p>
 <p>You remove a surface from a window by calling <a href="GUID-733B8BFA-7BC2-3A6D-A66F-F788413D25A9.html"><span class="apiname">RWindowBase::RemoveBackgroundSurface()</span></a>. This removes the surface and redraws the window. </p>
 <p><strong>Registering the surface for use on a screen </strong> </p>
 <p>You can optionally register a surface as a separate step before adding it as a background to a window. This enables the client to send a surface update to set up the first buffer that will be displayed when the surface is attached to a window. You register a surface by using <a href="GUID-733B8BFA-7BC2-3A6D-A66F-F788413D25A9.html"><span class="apiname">RWsSession::RegisterSurface()</span></a>. </p>
 <p>A given surface can be registered in multiple sessions and on multiple screens. However, you must not call <samp class="codeph">RWsSession::RegisterSurface()</samp> more than once per session for a given combination of surface and screen, without explicitly unregistering the surface first. </p>
 <p>Explicitly registered surfaces can be unregistered in two ways: </p>
 <ul><li id="GUID-ADA8CECB-0E70-5B9C-8F36-0714AAF0CD13__GUID-66C7BAC5-5973-5630-BC36-71B2D8A39CCE"><a name="GUID-ADA8CECB-0E70-5B9C-8F36-0714AAF0CD13__GUID-66C7BAC5-5973-5630-BC36-71B2D8A39CCE"><!-- --></a><p>A call to <a href="GUID-733B8BFA-7BC2-3A6D-A66F-F788413D25A9.html"><span class="apiname">RWsSession::UnregisterSurface()</span></a>. </p>
 </li>
 <li id="GUID-ADA8CECB-0E70-5B9C-8F36-0714AAF0CD13__GUID-4280F80D-E226-5AD5-BE3A-74802C6ABA5F"><a name="GUID-ADA8CECB-0E70-5B9C-8F36-0714AAF0CD13__GUID-4280F80D-E226-5AD5-BE3A-74802C6ABA5F"><!-- --></a><p>Closing the session. </p>
 </li>
 </ul>
 <p>When the session is closed, all of the surfaces explicitly registered with that session are unregistered. Closing a session also closes any windows associated with that session. Any surfaces directly assigned to those windows are also unregistered. </p>
