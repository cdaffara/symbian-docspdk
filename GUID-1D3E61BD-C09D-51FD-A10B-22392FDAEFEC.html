<h1 class="topictitle1">Inactivity
Monitoring and Peripheral Low Power States</h1>
<div><p>Peripheral inactivity can be defined as the state when that peripheral’s
driver has no pending request and is not performing background tasks.</p>

<p>It is recommended that peripheral drivers monitor peripheral inactivity
because they are in the best position to understand the current hardware requirement. </p>

<p>The preferred approach is to implement inactivity monitoring in the platform
specific portion of peripheral drivers. However it is not always possible
to safely do it that way. In this case, an interface between the platform
specific and generic portions of the driver might need to be devised leading
to, in the future, inactivity monitoring functionality or assistance being
included in generic components. </p>

<p>In some cases the developer of the driver might decide to implement inactivity
monitoring with a grace delay, using timers. For example, consider a peripheral
used as a data input device. If the only way that the platform specific layer
of the peripheral driver has any knowledge that an input request is pending,
and that data is arriving, is when an incoming unit of data causes an interrupt,
then the resulting ISR (or deferred DFC) could re-start a timer with a suitable
period. Inactivity could be monitored in the timer callback. This guarantees
that if another unit of data arrives before the timer expiration, the peripheral
is still in its operational power state. </p>

on the performance of either the peripheral driver or the upper layer components
that use it. </p>

 <p>Note that peripheral power states are a notion that only applies
to the peripheral hardware block, and not to the driver. The peripheral driver
is the component that requests the peripheral to transition between these
states. </p>
 <p>Note also that both Operational and Low Power states are subsets
of the Peripheral "Active" state. In some cases the differences in power consumption
between the Operational and Low Power modes might not be significant as, with
some hardware, only part of the peripheral needs to be operational to service
a particular type of request. </p>

 <p>If the peripheral is capable of keeping its internal state,
and the transition out of this mode is either done automatically on hardware,
or controlled by software, but has no impact on the performance of the peripheral

between power states under the peripheral driver's software control. However,
transitioning peripherals to a low power state should only be performed if
it can be done transparently to the users and consumers of the services provided
by that peripheral. Negligible interactive delays may be acceptable, data
loss is not acceptable. </p>
 <p>The transition of a peripheral to a low power
state can be requested by the platform-dependent layers of that peripheral
driver after inactivity, as defined above, has been detected. That request
usually assumes the form of a request to turn a controllable power resource
off. The request should be handled by the ASSP/Variant component that manages
platform power resources (the resource manager). </p>
 <p>It can also assume
the form of an operation required to put the peripheral in standby mode. In
this case the peripheral driver is totally responsible for handling the transition
to the low power state. </p>

to and from a peripheral low power state are long enough to have an impact
on system performance, or cause loss of data, or the peripheral is not capable
of detecting the hardware events required to guarantee correct operation while
in a low power state. If this is the case, then the decision to transition
to a low power state cannot be taken solely by the peripheral driver, and
will have to be taken in agreement with the users and consumers of the services

 <p>It can be assumed that when the peripheral driver is loaded, the
peripheral is put into the <em>Low Power</em> state. If a new request is asserted
on that peripheral driver from a user of that peripheral (which can include
another dependent peripheral driver or user side Engine/server/application),
the peripheral should move to its <em>Operational Power</em> state. The driver
can then start monitoring for peripheral inactivity, and when that is detected,
and no other dependent peripheral is using this peripheral, it can move the
peripheral back to the <em>Low Power</em> state. </p>
 <p>If, however, the power
manager requests the driver to power down the peripheral and no other dependent
peripheral is using it, it then moves into its <em>Off</em> state from which
it can only return to the <em>Operational Power</em> state when the power manager
issues a power up request. Moving from the <em>Off</em> state to the <em>Operational
Power</em> state is a relatively lengthy operation and requires resetting the
internal state of the peripheral. </p>
 <p>If another dependent peripheral
is using this peripheral, and the power manager issues a power down request,
then the driver keeps the peripheral in its operational power state until
the dependent peripheral relinquishes its request on it. </p>
 <p>From the <em>Low
Power</em> state, a peripheral can also be turned Off (unconditionally) if
the power manager so requests. It can be moved back to the <em>Operational
Power</em> state on an internal event (Interrupt, Timer). </p>
