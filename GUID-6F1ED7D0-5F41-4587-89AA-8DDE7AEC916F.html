<li><p><strong>ScreenPlay, also known as the New Graphics Architecture
(NGA):</strong> This new graphics architecture enables device creators
to take advantage of improved software performance, hardware acceleration
and third party graphics engines. It makes it possible to combine
UI components, graphics and video to create highly innovative UIs.

<li><p><strong>Extended Bitmaps:</strong> The Font and Bitmap Server provides a framework for device creators
to add support for their own types of bitmap compression. Bitmaps
that use compression formats that are provided by device creators
are known as extended bitmaps.

<li><p><strong>Multiple Touch Support:</strong> The ScreenPlay version of the
Window Server has been extended to support multiple advanced pointers,
with support for proximity and pressure. The emulator now also supports
multiple advanced pointers. For more information, see <a href="GUID-A12A66ED-2C8F-5CE6-8F3E-332B045A35B4.html" title="In ScreenPlay, the Window Server provides advanced pointer features, such as support for multiple pointers and proximity and pressure coordinates.">Advanced Pointers</a>.</p>

<li><p><strong>Enhanced Touch UI:</strong> The touch UI includes the following
improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Multi-page Home Screen enables the user to navigate between
widgets with a simple flick gesture</p>
</li>

<li><p>Capacitive multiple touch events are supported.</p>
